  <h2> Favorite Movie: Avatar</h2>
  <p>
    Avatar, directed by James Cameron, is one of my all-time favorite movies. The film is set on the visually stunning planet of Pandora and follows the journey of a former marine who becomes part of the native Na'vi tribe. I love the movie for its groundbreaking visual effects, strong environmental message, and imaginative storytelling. It's a perfect mix of action, emotion, and adventure.

  <h2> Favorite Book: Wings of Fire</h2>
  <p>
    "Wings of Fire" is an inspiring autobiography by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India. The book beautifully captures his journey from a small town in Rameswaram to becoming a top scientist and a national leader. It teaches the value of hard work, determination, and dreaming big. I find it deeply motivational and full of life lessons that guide me even today.

  <h2> Favorite Food: Biryani</h2>
  <p>
    Biryani is my absolute favorite dish. It's a flavorful mix of rice, spices, and meat or vegetables, cooked to perfection. I especially love Hyderabadi Biryani for its rich aroma and bold taste. Whether it's a special occasion or a regular day, Biryani never fails to satisfy my cravings. It's not just a dishâ€”it's an emotion for food lovers like me!
