  We already know that everything around our planet, our bodies, everything—is made up of atoms. So maybe, just maybe, each of those atoms also contains multiple universes within it. That would mean the Earth itself could be part of an atom in another, much bigger world, existing in its own timeline.
Think about a small insect inside a room. For that insect, the room feels like its whole world. If it somehow gets outside, the outside world will seem like an entirely new universe to it—something too massive and complex to understand. But for us humans, that same world is completely normal and familiar.
