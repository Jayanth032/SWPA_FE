  <title>i vs em</title>

  <p>
    Both the <i>&lt;i&gt;</i> and <em>&lt;em&gt;</em> tags are used to italicize text, 
    but they serve different purposes. The <i>&lt;i&gt;</i> tag is typically used 
    for styling text in a different voice or tone, such as technical terms, foreign words, or thoughts. 
    On the other hand, the <em>&lt;em&gt;</em> tag is used to give <em>emphasis</em> to words 
    that are important in the context, and screen readers will also recognize this added meaning. 
    So while both appear italicized by default, <em><strong>&lt;em&gt; has semantic value</strong></em>, 
    whereas <i>&lt;i&gt;</i> is more presentational.
