  <h2>Simple Poem: The Morning Light</h2>

  <pre>
The sun peeks over the hill,  
Its golden rays so calm and still.  
Birds awaken with cheerful song,  
Welcoming a day that's fresh and long.  

The breeze is soft, the sky so blue,  
A perfect start, so bright and true.  
Nature whispers, "Rise and shine,"  
For this sweet world is yours and mine.
