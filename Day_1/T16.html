    <b>Water</b> is one of the most <b>essential resources</b> for all living beings on Earth. 
    It covers about 71% of the planetâ€™s surface and is vital for drinking, farming, and cleaning. 
    <u>Scientists</u> often describe it as the most important natural element. 
    As the quote says, <i>"Water is life."</i> Without water, no <b>plant, animal, or human</b> can survive. 
    <u>Dr. Ramesh</u>, a leading environmentalist, always says that we must <b>conserve water</b> to ensure a better future.
