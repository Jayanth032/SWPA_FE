<h2>What Are Natural Calamities?</h2>
<p>
Natural calamities are extreme, unexpected events caused by environmental factors that <strong>result in loss of life, property, and resources</strong>.

<h2>Types of Natural Calamities</h2>
<p>
Some common types include:<br>
– <u>Earthquakes</u>: Sudden shaking of the ground caused by seismic activity.<br>
– <u>Floods</u>: Overflow of water submerging normally dry land.<br>
– <u>Droughts</u>: Long periods of insufficient rainfall.<br>
– <u>Hurricanes and Cyclones</u>: Powerful storms with heavy winds and rain.<br>

</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
