The MARL Snake Game project aims to simulate intelligent agents learning in a shared environment. <br>
Each snake operates independently but shares a common learning framework. <br>
The use of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) enables decision-making based on environmental rewards.
</p>

<p>
Training is performed in Google Colab with results visualized locally using a custom Pygame viewer. <br>
The snakes grow by consuming food and learn to avoid walls and each other. <br>
Over time, the agents improve their coordination and survival strategies through reinforcement learning.
