In my Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) Snake Game project, I implemented multiple autonomous snakes that learn to navigate the grid and avoid collisions using a shared <code>Deep Q-Network (DQN)</code>. Each snake observes its environment and makes decisions based on learned policies. The environment is built in <code>Python</code> without using <code>torch</code> or <code>CUDA</code>, and the training occurs in Google Colab. To start the game manually in the local viewer, the user needs to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to run the script and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to exit. The project showcases intelligent agent coordination and real-time movement in a visually distinct grid environment.
