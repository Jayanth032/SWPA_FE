<h3>Life’s a journey, not a race,<br>
Every step leads to a place.<br>
Through the storms and darkest night,<br>
Keep on walking toward the light.<br>
Failures teach and make you strong,<br>
Every setback won’t last long.<br>
Rise with courage, stand up tall,<br>
You were born to conquer all.
